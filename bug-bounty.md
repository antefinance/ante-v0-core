# Bug Bounty

[Ante](https://www.ante.finance) is a decentralized protocol to build the Schelling Point of Computational Trust.

This bug bounty program is focused on our smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:

- Theft or freezing of user funds aside from normal functioning of AntePool contract
- Incorrect calculation of rewards for stakers/challengers beyond error bounds described in technical doc
- Incorrect calculation of decay payments beyond error bounds described in technical doc
- False positive triggering of test failure on AntePool even if underlying test did not fail or revert

For more details, please visit our [Immunefi program page](https://immunefi.com/bounty/antefinance/).

## Responsible Disclosure

Previously undiscovered vulnerabilities can be submitted (including conditions/steps to reproduce the vulnerability) through our [Immunefi bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/antefinance/) and/or to [security@ante.finance](mailto:security@ante.finance?subject=Responsible%20Bug%20Disclosure) for priority escalation. Ante will follow up within 48 hours to acknowledge the disclosure and discuss next steps.

Any vulnerabilities should not be disclosed publicly or to other parties until the Ante team has had a chance to triage and address the vulnerability. All testing or proof of concepts should be done on private testnets, and must not have already been exploited for damage.
We are happy to publicly credit you for your discovery (unless you prefer otherwise), and eligibility for existing bug bounty programs (e.g. Immunefi) will not (subject to our discretion) be voided by communicating with [security@ante.finance](mailto:security@ante.finance?subject=Responsible%20Bug%20Disclosure).

## Rewards

Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System](https://immunefi.com/severity-updated).
